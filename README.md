# LyricSpotter
An Android application for searching the lyrics of a song!

This app uses both the Spotify Android SDK and JSoup in order to determine what lyrics search.
Connecting through Spotify allows the application to search for the song that is currently being played through the application. However, the app can also be used without connecting Spotify.

There's also an option to open up an overlay to the application, which when pressed automatically opens up the app for use.

This app was a project for fun and to practice my skills with Android development and working with APIs. I'll hopefully be continuing to update this project throughout the future, so keep an eye out for updates!

If there's any questions or issues, please feel free to create an issue or send me an email: rayf1013@cs.washington.edu.
